<VoiceCall 
  callerName="Custom Name"
  callerAvatar="/path/to/avatar.jpg"
  description="Custom description"
  apiUrl={{
    callStatus: 'https://your-api.com/call-status',
    chatStream: 'https://your-api.com/chat-stream'
  }}
  debug={true}
/>
```

- Call status: `/api/chat/call-status`
- Chat stream: `/api/chat/stream`
